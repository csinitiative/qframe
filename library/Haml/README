- Items that are not supported
  - IE conditional comments
  - Multi-line strings
  - Filters
  
- There is currently also an issue with constructs such as:

  - if(foo == bar)
    ...
  - else
    ...
    
  related to the fact that the rendered code looks something like:
  
  <?php if(foo == bar) { ?>
    ...
  <?php } ?>
  <?php else { ?>
    ...
  <?php } ?>
  
  instead of:
  
  <?php if(foo == bar) { ?>
    ...
  <?php } else { ?>
    ...
  <?php } ?>
  
  This will clearly need to be fixed at some point as this is a somewhat problematic issue.  Now
  is not the time however.  In the meantime this construct will have to be used instead:
  
  - if(foo == bar)
    ...
  - if(foo != bar)
    ...
