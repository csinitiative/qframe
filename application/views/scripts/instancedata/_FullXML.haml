  Responses XML Document
This XML document contains both question and response information. This document is used to import an instance into another installation or another enterprise system.  If you want to export any attachments associated with this instance, it must be exported as a Zip Archive.  PDF exports cannot later be imported and only serve as a human-readable version.
